# XML Validator in SWI-Prolog

Validate an XML Document against an XML Schema in SWI-Prolog.

## Installation

First of all, you need [SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/).
Take a look at the official website for installation instructions.

After that, you have to install the latest version of the [regex](http://www.swi-prolog.org/pack/list?p=regex) library.
Installation instructions for this library can be found with the provided link.

If you are a developer of this project, you must also install the [tap](http://www.swi-prolog.org/pack/list?p=tap) library in order to successfully execute our tests.

### Pre-Compilation

It is possible to create a pre-compiled file which increases the tool's performance significantly. The command line interface is compiled using swipl's [`-c` option](http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=section%282,%272.10%27,swi%28%27/doc/Manual/compilation.html%27%29%29):

```sh
swipl -g main -o cli.exe -c cli.pl
```

The `.exe` suffix is chosen for compatibility with Windows systems.

## Usage as CLI

A command line interface is provided, too. You can directly execute it via

```sh
swipl -g main cli.pl -- schema.xsd instance.xml
```

Call with `--help` instead of the filenames to get more options.

After the pre-compilation step mentioned before, the created executable can be called via:

```sh
./cli.exe schema.xsd instance.xml
```

## Usage with SWI-Prolog

The `library(xsd)` exports the following predicates:

*   `xsd_validate(+Schema, +Document)`

    Validates an XML Document with Identifier `Document` against an XML Schema `Schema`.

The `library(xsd/flatten)` exports the following predicates:

*   `xml_flatten(+Input, ?Identifier)`

    Loads an XML file from source `Input` into the prolog database. 
    An `Identifier` can be freely chosen, otherwise it will be generated.

*   `remove_file(+Identifier)`

    Deletes all nodes corresponding to `Identifier` from the prolog database.

### Example Call

```prolog
?- use_module(library(xsd)),
   xsd_validate('path/to/schema.xsd', 'path/to/instance.xml').
```

## XML File Representation

Once an XML file is loaded using `xml_flatten/2`, it will be represented by the following predicates:

*   `node(File_ID, ID, Namespace, Node)`

    Each node in the document `File_ID` is represented by a node/4 fact with the unique identifier `ID`. Also, the namespace and the name of the element are stated. 

*   `node_attribute(File_ID, ID, Attribute, Value)`

    For every attribute a `node_attribute/4` fact is generated. It stores the `Attribute` and `Value` of an attribute associated to node `ID` inside document `File_ID`.

*   `text_node(File_ID, ID, Node)`

    Text inside the document `File_ID` is represented as `text_node/3` facts. These have unique identifiers like regular document nodes and store the text `Node`.
